    "Scikit-learn is a library in Python that provides many unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms. It’s built upon some of the technology you might already be familiar with, like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib [1] Scikit-learn is a Python library created by David Cournapeau in 2007 as a Google Summer of Code project. Scikit-learn efficiently implements many of the machine learning algorithms. [3] The library is focused on modeling data. Scikit-learn aims on bringing machine learning to non-specialists. It puts an importance on its ease of use, performance, documentation, and API consistency. It has minimal dependencies and is distributed under the simplified BSD license, encouraging its use in both academic and commercial settings [4] Scikit-learn is built upon NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib."
