The aim of this notebook is to provide a clear and concise overview of the Python package SciPy-Stats and an example hypothesis test using ANOVA. This will be achieved by reseaching the package and demonstrating it's functionality through using a data set for which using ANOVA is suitable."

Quantitative data can be broken down into discrete data. This is data which is represented in whole numbers e.g. how many people are in the crowd. Continuous data is data which can take any value within a range e.g. a person height can be any value within the range of human heights [8].\n"
